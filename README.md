# MENU-IMAGE-TO-AUDIO---GOOGLE-COLAB-VERSION

reading it.

First, the user gives a menu image. You can upload a picture, use a URL from the internet, or try a sample menu. Once the image is ready, the system needs to read the text from it. This is done using Gemini AI, which is smart enough to look at the picture and find all the words. It keeps the lines and spacing just like in the menu so nothing is missed.

After the text is extracted, it is shown on the screen. This way, you can check if everything is correct before turning it into audio. Then, the text is sent to Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), which converts the words into an MP3 audio file. gTTS reads the text clearly and naturally.

Finally, the audio is played right in Google Colab. You can hear the menu items immediately, and the MP3 file can also be saved to use later.

In short, the project works in four main steps: Image → Text → Audio → Play. You give a menu image, the AI reads it, the text is converted into speech, and you can listen to it. It’s a beginner-friendly way to turn pictures of menus into spoken audio, making menus easier to understand and more accessible for everyone.
